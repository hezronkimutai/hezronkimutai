        <h2>About me</h2>
I am an allround web developer. I am a senior
        programmer with good knowledge of front-end techniques. I love structure
        and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time on fixing
        little details and optimizing web apps. Also I like working in a team,
        you&apos;ll learn faster and much more. As the saying goes: &apos;two heads are
        better than one&apos;.
